### Summary
> If the city were to include the bike-sharing program it will provide a lots of benefits. Such as environmental friendliness, and easier and faster way to maneuver throughout the city. To duplicate this types of service or transportation by data can be shown to work the best for many.

>According to the free data provide by Citibike I would suggest basing the data on gender. The gender data seem to follow the same line and are very similar. However, I would add or focus more on age the data and the get detail and specific. Also, to include the benefits/ goals it would accomplish. 

>Furthermore, the information for the visualizations should include the percentage/cost per bike (type) and distance. This will helped the program to reach out to larger or smaller cities to base their decisions if they want to include this type of services in their location.
